# Database
<p align = "justify">
  This GIU-base API was deigned to tailor to a specific overnight policy.
The overnight policy is based to a student-housing policy, the policy consists on a maximum of 6 free nights with a period wait of 30 days for each night used. For Example, student x has 6 free nights and wants to registered his guest for one overnight, June 6th will be registered as one overnight used in the student’s profile, the student will have 5 free nights left and by July 6th the student will get back the overnight used into the student’s profile which it will be get back to 6 free nights. The 6 free nights will not reset every month.
  
  However, the software will not only communicate and retrieve data from the database. The overnight policy is implemented into the software. The user is responsible to input the correct data into the databased and the program will do the rest.
The program will do the following tasks, update overnights, distribute data into the panel based on the user request, adding and subtracting days based on user input and updated overnights by the system. A separated registration GUI system is added with administrative privileges to delete wrong data and register employees into the system with privilages.  

The imagine below shows the structure of the database. </p>
