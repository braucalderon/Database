# Java Application
<p align = "justify">
  This GIU-base Java application was deigned to tailor to a specific overnight policy.
The policy consists on a maximum of 6 free nights with a period wait of 30 days for each night used. A charged will be applied after the 6 night. For Example, student x has 6 free nights and wants to register his guest for one overnight, June 6th will be registered as one overnight used in the studentâ€™s profile, the student will have then 5 free nights left out of the 6 free nights. By July 6th the student will get back the overnight used into the "account or profile" which it will add that overnight into the 5 free overnights.</p>
<p align = "justify">
  However, the software will not only communicate and retrieve data. The overnight policy is implemented into the software. The user is responsible to input the correct data and the program will update the database.
The program will do the following tasks, update overnights, distribute data into the panel based on the user request, adding and subtracting days based on user input and updated overnights from the remote database. A separated registration GUI system is added with administrative privileges to delete wrong data and register employees into the system with privilages. </p> 

The imagine below shows the structure of the database.

## `CHALLENGES:`

### FOR LOOPS
<p align = "justify">
Iterations using for loops were used to cut unnecessary extra code for better functionality. I learned new techniques using for loops to achieve a faster output by implementing additional conditions into the statement.  A lot of triggers that could had been implemented into the database were applied into the code instead.</p>

### BRANCHING USING IF-ELSE STATEMENTS
<p align = "justify">
A lot of if-else statements were used to update and retrieve data, using this concept was difficult because of the run-time performance affecting the program which it prompted the database to get locked out. The runtime performance issues encountered were solved by using for loops, and rearranging the structural layout of the code.</p>

### NOTE
<p align = "justify">
This concept even though it was my first personal project, I learned a lot and overtime I realized the mistakes done on the code, even though it works. Simple mistakes like making it more readable, for example, creating separate classes with the ability to upgrade it and improve the system without affecting the rest of the code. Another concept missed in the code was the implementation of java principles like encapsulation as of my understanding so far with this concept and polymorphism. The only java principle applied to this project is inheritance.</p>
