# Database

The program will consist in handing data, approximately 200 to 400 entries, with the availability to login with username and 
password popup window. Options in the main window will include delete, search and save data to the database. The program will 
be able to pull out two different records from the database to the main GUI window for the user to look. Triggers will be 
implemented to specific entries inserted into the database.
